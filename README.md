# ML Vote OMR Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning application using Optical Mark Recognition (OMR) to analyze voting data. The project utilizes the YOLO model to detect and interpret marks on scanned images of ballots, facilitating automated vote tallying.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to automate the processing of voting data from scanned ballot images. This aims to increase accuracy and efficiency in vote counting and reduce the potential for human error.

## Key Achievements
- **Transparency Enhancement**: Developed a model that interprets handwritten vote tally forms, significantly enhancing election reporting transparency in Nusantara.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 27.86%, demonstrating the model's robustness and accuracy in real-world applications

## Features
- **Automated Ballot Processing**: Automatically process scanned images of ballots.
- **Vote Counting**: Utilize OMR techniques to identify and count votes based on handwriting.
- **Accuracy and Efficiency**: Uses sophisticated algorithms to ensure accurate vote counting and reduce potential errors.
